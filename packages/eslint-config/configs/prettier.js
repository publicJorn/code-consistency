// Disable rules that interfere with how prettier works.
// There is a plugin for this called eslint-plugin-prettier.
// However, that plugin disables mostly rules that are already deprecated by eslint.
// The following are the only ones that still apply:
export const configPrettier = [
  {
    name: 'devJorn/prettier',
    rules: {
      curly: 'off',
      'no-unexpected-multiline': 'off',
    },
  },
]
